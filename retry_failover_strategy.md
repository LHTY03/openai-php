# Multi-Provider AI Request Retry & Failover Strategy

**Author:** System Architect Team  
**Date:** 2025-04-11  
**Purpose:** Provide a thorough, production-grade plan for managing intelligent request retry, failover, and provider switching across multiple AI platforms (OpenAI, Grok, Gemini, Perplexity, etc.).

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Modern AI applications often rely on third-party providers to deliver services like chat completion, image generation, and embeddings. Each provider comes with:
- Different API formats and model names
- Rate limits and usage quotas
- Variability in reliability and latency

**Goal:** Build a resilient, intelligent system to:
- Retry failed requests based on error type
- Switch to backup providers when needed
- Optimize usage and maintain conversation context
- Reduce token and cost overhead during failover

---

## 🎯 Key Design Objectives

1. **High Availability**: Maximize uptime even if a provider is down or rate-limited.
2. **Seamless Provider Switching**: Hide complexity from users.
3. **Token Efficiency**: Avoid resending large histories unnecessarily.
4. **Provider-Aware Retry Logic**: Different providers have different tolerance for errors, we must handle accordingly.
5. **Granular Control**: Fine-tune retry limits, provider fallback chains, and model mappings.

## 🧱 Core Components

### 1. **Capability Map (capabilities.json)**

A structured metadata file mapping features (chat, image, etc.) to supported providers and model names.

Example:
```json
{
  "chat_completion": {
    "openai": ["gpt-4", "gpt-3.5-turbo"],
    "grok": ["grok-2-latest"],
    "perplexity": ["pplx-70b-chat"],
    "gemini": ["gemini-1.5-pro"]
  },
  "image_generation": {
    "openai": ["dall-e-3"],
    "stabilityai": ["stable-diffusion-xl"]
  }
}
```

---

### 2. **Usage Tracker**

Tracks per-minute tokens and request usage per provider.
```php
[
  'tokens_used' => 0,
  'max_tokens' => 100000,
  'requests_used' => 0,
  'max_requests' => 1000,
  'window_start' => 1712846400
]
```

Used to enforce switching at ~90% usage or for planning intelligent load balancing.

---

### 3. **Session-to-Provider Mapping**

Avoids switching providers mid-conversation unless absolutely necessary.  
```php
[
  'session-abc123' => 'openai'
]
```

Maintains coherence and prevents token overload.

## ⚙️ Retry & Failover Algorithm

### Input:
- `session_id`
- `task_type` (chat_completion, image_generation, etc.)
- `args`, `model`, `params`

### Step-by-step Flow:

#### ✅ Step 1: Get Primary Provider
- Use pinned provider from session map if present.
- If not, default to top priority provider for the task.

#### 📊 Step 2: Check Usage Thresholds
- If current token or request usage ≥ 90%, flag for potential failover.
- Exception: if request is part of a continuing conversation, allow temporarily.

#### 🔁 Step 3: Attempt API Call (with Retries)
- Execute request to provider.
- If success → log usage and return.
- If failure:
  - Retry up to `N` times if error is retryable (e.g., 408, 502).
  - Retry with exponential backoff (e.g., wait 1s, 2s, 4s).

#### 🔀 Step 4: Fallback Logic
- If retries fail or provider is flagged at limit:
  - Look up fallback list from `capabilities.json`
  - Skip providers that:
    - Don't support task
    - Are above limit
  - Remap model if needed (e.g., `gpt-4` → `grok-2-latest`)
  - Reattempt request

#### 🧾 Step 5: Log and Return
- Record switch decision, response time, token cost.
- Return successful response or throw exception if all fail.

## 🧪 Error Classification Table

| Error Code | Retryable? | Trigger Failover? | Notes                            |
|------------|------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| 429        | ❌         | ✅                | Rate limit exceeded              |
| 408        | ✅         | ✅ after N tries  | Timeout                          |
| 500-503    | ✅         | ✅ after retries  | Provider error                   |
| 400        | ❌         | ❌                | Bad request, developer mistake   |

## 💡 Advanced Enhancements

### 1. **Dynamic Load Balancing**
- Spread traffic across providers even if not at limit.

### 2. **Cost Optimization**
- Prefer cheaper models if urgency is low.

### 3. **Health Monitoring**
- Track real-time provider health via status endpoints or latency averages.

### 4. **Model Equivalence Graph**
- Maintain a map of interchangeable models by task type.
