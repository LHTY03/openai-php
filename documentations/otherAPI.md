We would be focusing on 3 LLMs right now, if time allows, we could expand the
field of the project further into more LLM models that incorporate the openAi
api as their format of API calls.

The three LLM models that we would be working on right now would include Grok,
Gemini, and Perplexity. And here are the documentations below for the different APIs.


Grok:
The official documentation of the the Grok API is listed on the following link:
https://docs.x.ai/docs/overview

For our project specifically, we want to integrate the Grok API into the OpenAI API
and make sure that they would work with the same parameters, so the specific page 
that we want to look at is the following: 

https://docs.x.ai/docs/guides/migration.

According to the Grok documentation, we could see that the change is pretty simple
when it comes to changing the API call, there are only two lines of required changes,
which is the base_url and the model name, which are both variables that we are capable
of changing in the library.


Gemini:
The Official documentation of Gemini is the following:
https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs

The Gemini documentation for OpenAI API compatibility are relatively similar to what 
we had seen with the Grok documentation, it is specified that there are 3 lines that 
we would have to change, and they are the API keys, base_url, andmodel (a model name 
that is recognizable by gemini).

Looking at these Gemini models, there are no big difference from what we seen from the 
Grok tuning with compatibility of the OpenAI API, which is a really good news to us 
especially when we are aiming for development to integrate the different LLMs

The following is the OpenAI compatibility web link of Gemini:

Perplexity:
