This file is for documenting the specifics of what we are looking for at other LLM's API,
We would be checking for the adoptation of the other APIs, and would record the given
documentation and out own understanding in the following document.

Since the goal is to change the library and include LLMs from other providers
into the openai-php/client repo, we would need to  first understand the general 
code of the library. We would have multiple files to record our finding in the first week,
after we are famaliar with the library and the language, we could start the process of manipulating
the API library and launching the testing field. 

This folder documentation is what we would be working on documenting all of the different 
informations from different AI APIs, understandings of the php code library, and attempt to change
whatever is in the library.
